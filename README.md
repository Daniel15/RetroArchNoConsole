RetroArchNoConsole
==================

RetroArch displays a console (command line window) when you run it, and there's no built-in way to hide it. This can mess with some emulation frontends or with Steam Link. RetroArchNoConsole is a simple app that runs RetroArch and hides its console window.

Usage
=====
1. Download the RetroArchNoConsole.exe file from https://d.sb/ranc-dl
2. Copy it to the same directory as your RetroArch installation
3. Run RetroArchNoConsole.exe instead of RetroArch.exe
